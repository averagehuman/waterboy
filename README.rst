Felicity - Dynamic Application settings
=======================================

A library for storing editable settings in pluggable backend data stores.
There is builtin support for Redis, MongoDB and Django model backends.

This is a forked and significantly updated version of `django-constance`_ by
Jannis Leidel and others (see AUTHORS file).

`felicity`_ aims to be framework-agnostic but will fall back to use Django
settings if possible, and in this case will work similarly to the original
project.
